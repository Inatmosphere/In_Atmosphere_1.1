<h3>
    Shambler:
<h3>
  <h4>
    Infected unarmed personnel, resembles a pair of legs attoped by swollen biomass, near unrecognizable to the original being.
    Will charge towards any uninfected entities and violently combust upon closing the gap. Combustion of the being compresses a hollow, conical formation
    of bone and cartilage in the direction of uninfected entities, more often then not to grim result. Is highly sensitive to light and sound, will often 
    exhibit poor eyesight, though there are exeptions to this rule.

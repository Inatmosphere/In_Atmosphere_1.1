<h3>
    Eridani Combined Coalition:
<h3>
<h4>
    The Eridani Combined Coalition(ECC) is the military alliance between all planets contained within the Eridani
    system. It being formed in response to the creation of the UCSC during the Centauri systems war, though it officially 
    never entered that conflict. The weapon technolgies employed by the Coalition vary heavily, though 
    highly differs from their adversaries(UCSC) in that smart and novel material projectiles are far more common place than 
    high velocity impact reliant weapons. This is largely due to the ECC never signing any treaties regarding the 
    weaponization of the later projectile type listed as a consiquence of never being officially part of the conflict that
    made them warcrimes.

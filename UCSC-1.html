  <h4>
    The United Centauri Space Command(UCSC) is the military arm of the Centauri systems government. 
    Being founded in 2321, when the Centauri system split away from Earth. The climax of the split 
    being a five year long war of independence fought by the UCSC. The weapon technolgies employed by the UCSC 
    in its space and ground theaters largely revolve around precise high velocity impact by a variety of 
    means, one of which as a consiquence of the systems abundance of superconductor production being 
    electromagnetic induction weapons that send payloads to realitivistic speeds at anything unfortunate
